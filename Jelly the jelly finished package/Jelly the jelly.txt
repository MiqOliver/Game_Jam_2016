Jelly the jelly is an "easy to learn, fun to master" infinite faller, that tests
the players abillity to think on the fly. You will be tasked of taking control
of a gelatin qube, as it falls down an infinite well. But be careful, on your
way you will face dangers like deadly spikes, solid platforms and an ever
accelarating gravity. Armed with nothing but your own wit and the
ability to fall left or right, how far can you get? Will you find the bottom
of this seemingly endless pit, or will you sucumb to gravity like so many
others have before you?
